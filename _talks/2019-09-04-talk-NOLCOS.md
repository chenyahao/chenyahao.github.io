We study two kinds of linearization (internal and external) of nonlinear
differential-algebraic equations DAEs of semi-explicit SE form. The difference of external and
internal linearization is illustrated by an example of a mechanical system. Moreover, we define
different levels of external equivalence for two SE DAEs. The proposed explicitation procedure
allows us to treat a given SE DAE as a control system defined up to feedback transformation (a
class of control systems). Then sufficient and necessary conditions, expressed via explicitation
procedure, are given to describe when a given SE DAE is level-3 externally equivalent to a
linear SE DAE of some specific forms. At last, we show by an example that level-2 external
linearization of a DAE can be achieved if its explicitation is level-2 input-output linearizable.
