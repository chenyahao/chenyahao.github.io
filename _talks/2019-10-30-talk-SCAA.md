We relate the feedback canonical form FNCF  of differential-algebraic controlsystems (DACSs) with the famous Morse canonical form MCF  of ordinary differential
equation control systems (ODECSs). First, a procedure called an explicitation (with driving variables) is proposed to connect the two above categories of control systems by attaching to a DACS a class of ODECSs with two kinds of inputs (the original control input u and a vector of driving
variables v). Then, we show that any ODECS with two kinds of inputs can be transformed into itsextended MCF via two intermediate forms: the extended Morse triangular form and the extended Morse normal form. Next, we illustrate that the FNCF of a DACS and the extended MCF of the explicitation system have a perfect one-to-one correspondence. At last, an algorithm is proposed to transform a given DACS into its FBCF via the explicitation procedure and a numerical example is
given to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
