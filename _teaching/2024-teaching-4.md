I was a lecturer of the course "Advanced Control of Electric Vehicle (ACEV)" for M2 students of Erasmus Epico programme at Ecole Centrale Nantes (ECN).  


Course description:
======

This course introduces the concept of control of electric motors for electric vehicle application. Initially, the dynamic models of the ac motors are developed that will be useful in understanding the dynamic control. Advanced control techniques are applied to optimize the performance of ac motor drives. 

• Application-Specific Selection of Machine-and-Drive Systems
• High-Speed Electric Machines
• Control principles for electrical motor drives
• Performances improvement of AC machines control
• Sensorless control of AC machines
